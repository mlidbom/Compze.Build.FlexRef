<!--
  Example .v3.ncrunchsolution for a consumer-only solution where
  Acme.Utilities and Acme.Core are NOT in the solution and should
  come from NuGet packages.

  Place this file alongside the .sln file with the same base name:
    ConsumerOnly.sln
    ConsumerOnly.v3.ncrunchsolution

  For a full solution where all libraries are included,
  omit the CustomBuildProperties element (or leave it empty).
